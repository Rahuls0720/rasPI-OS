# rasPI-OS

I took an operating systems course at UT Austin, interned on the BIOS team at HP, and interned at RedHat working on their container focused operating system. Yet, I have never gotten the chance to tie the advanced features I implemented in my OS course, like a scheduler or virtual memory, with other parts of the bootstrap boot up process. My aim for this project is to tie the advanced os features with  the BIOS code I worked with at HP with things like grub and systemd (implement my own versions) which I worked with at RedHat.

Lets see how this goes....
